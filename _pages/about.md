I’m **Linkai Ma**, a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at **Purdue University**, advised by [**Petros Drineas**](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pdrineas/). Before Purdue, I completed my **B.A./M.S. in Mathematics** at NYU’s [**Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences**](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/), where I was fortunate to work with Professor [**Dimitris Giannakis**](https://giannakis.host.dartmouth.edu/) for mathematical modeling of sea ice and Professor [**Olivier Pauluis**](https://wp.nyu.edu/opauluis/) for autoregressive DMD model of atmospheric annular mode. I also completed my [master thesis]({{ "/files/Master_Thesis.pdf" | relative_url }}) under the supervision of Professor Jonathan Weare.

My current research sits at the intersection of **numerical linear algebra**, **randomized algorithms**, and **theoretical machine learning**. I am especially interested in the regularization effects of stochastic rounding/quantization on linear systems and more complex models such as neural networks. My broader goal is to connect rigorous analysis (perturbation theory, concentration, random matrix tools) with **scalable, reliable numerical methods** for modern ML systems.

### Projects
- **Stochastic Rounding Implicitly Regularizes Tall-and-Thin Matrices.** When/how stochastic rounding regularizes the smallest singular value of a matrix.
- **A Note on the Stability of the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury.** How does matrix inversion errors propagate through SMW.


### Teaching 
At Purdue, I've been a teaching assistant for both undergraduate and graduate level numerical analysis courses. At NYU, I was a TA for calculus I. 

### A bit more about me
Outside research, I’m really into **music**, **traveling**, and **basketball**.
